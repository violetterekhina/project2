        <h1>A little about us</h1>
        <p>The Peopleâ€™s Art is a non-profit organization 
            dedicated to empowering and celebrating 
            Houston artists aged 40 and over. Over the years we have worked hard to create 
            a family-like environment for our artists. We 
            host art sales, master-classes, social events 
            and fundraisers. Our mission is to bring people 
            together through a shared love for art.
